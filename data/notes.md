# Notes on data collection

## Method

I listed all proper names mentioned in each page of the book. I used a single identifying name for each person, that is I listed under the same name all mentions by nicknames or alternative names. As alternative name I counted also references to a person by their relationship (e.g. Mum), but only if it is capitalized, e.g. _'my father'_(p.25) is not counted. I do not count mentions by personal pronouns ('_she_'). I do count cases where the is mentioned without referring to the particular person (e.g. '_Shirley's brothers_', p27 counts for Shirley). I do not count famous people referenced or mentioned by a person narrating, e.g. '_although Amma considered her more Artful Dodger than Oliver Twist_' (p.30) does not count as a mention of either Artful Dodger nor Oliver Twist. I do count as names pets ('_Lady Maisie_') but not brands of items ('_Chanel_'). I do not count possible alternative names, names that were not used but just suggested, eg "at least she didn't name herself Reginald or William (p. 352)

For the first chapter on top of listing names listed per page, I also counted the number of times a name was printed. I do not count consecutive mentions with a different alternative name, e.g. '_Sylvester, or Sylvie_', p31 was counted as 1 mention of Sylvester
